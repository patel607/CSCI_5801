How to run Voting System using IntelliJ:
1. Open Project1 directory in IntelliJ Idea Community Edition
2. Ensure Project Structure has 'src' and 'testing' folder correctly marked (so Intellij can find the tests).
3. Once Project1 directory is open, ensure that all java imports are added
    (We are using JUnit4; ensure JUnit4 is added to class path)
    (Use ALT+Enter to easily add JUnit4)
4. Put the desired ballot file in the Project1 directory
5. Go to Driver class in the src directory
6. Click the Green arrow on class Driver.
7. A terminal will appear at the bottom of the IntelliJ interface, input the file name to run Voting System
